These are so you can master your shamanistic power, and unlock season changes and calumny powers. \r\n\r\n**These Walls Can Talk:** You have to ignite a certain order of fire statues in order to gain access to an area.  \r\n\r\n**Target shot puzzle:**  Knock down all the targets before time runs out (wind power).  \r\n\r\n**Assemble your boat:**  You have to use the wind power to align a puzzle that creates a boat out of the pieces when assembled.\r\n\r\n**Rite of Passage:**  You battle enemies in an area to see how quickly you can eliminate them to get out of the area.  Too slow restarts.  \r\n\r\n**Flight of the Eagles:**  You guide eagles through a series of rings and sonic attacks (timed) to allow them to carry you through to another area. \r\n\r\n**The Wind Talker:**  A series of chimes make a distinct set of sounds.  You have to hit them with the wind in the order that the chimes sounded off.\r\n\r\n**I was Born to Set the World on Fire:**  You are on fire and you have to jump/run over enemies that will run away from you within a certain time.\r\n\r\n**Sunlight and Rain:**  You have water that flows through an area that only drains when you arrange all the pieces in the correct way.\r\n\r\n**Fast Ice: ** Your ice enables you to skate fast enough before a door slams shut.  The puzzle involves not being able to set the ice anywhere, but only in certain designated spots.  You use other powers to re-arrange where the ice can be set down until itâ€™s a full path.\r\n\r\n**Snake puzzle:**  Like the game where you have a line that chases you, it tries to box you in, but you have to box it in in order to win.  Leaves a trail.  (Shamanistic, but that sort of game.)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n* Three distinct paths (Left (hard puzzles) Central (Enemies) Right (Lots of puzzles). )\r\n* Path fixed when you complete/cross a puzzle.\r\n\r\n### Obstacles\r\n\r\n* Streams:\r\n\t* - Winter - Freeze and walk over.\r\n\t* - Summer - Steam the water and walk through.\r\n\t* - Fall - Boat of leaves and row.\r\n        * - Spring - Birds pick u up and glide you across / Spring climber acts as a bridge to get to          hidden/bonus areas\r\n        * - Knocking rocks off the side of a mountain to create a floating path.\r\n  \r\n\r\n* Higher altitude :-\r\n\t* - Winter - Snowman\r\n        * - Spring - create water then make steam. (Substitute for mini-game like Flight of the Eagles.) \r\n        * - Fall - Magic carpet of leaves\r\n\t* - Summer - Grow trees and climb\r\n\r\n**Hidden Door/passages:**\r\n\t- You can find a hidden door or passage lets say by activating symbols. Each symbol will be activated by a particular power or combination of power. The hints for the symbols,would be given prior to arriving at that location. So the player has to keep in mind what he saw.\r\n \r\n***\r\n\r\n### Collect Shaman token\r\n\r\nGain power from the enemies which are released from the season World to allow you to change the season. \r\nRefining that : free a soul/absorb a soul (whatever looks good) that is trapped in a magic room just before reaching a puzzle. Find that magic room, absorb it and viola you have the power to change the season but only for that puzzle. So for the next puzzle to need to free/absorb another soul. or defeat a spirit, absorb its soul and gain the power to control seasons. or both at some places. The player chooses in that case.\r\n\r\nCollect the power from a mini-game, you win, you can change the season.  ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
