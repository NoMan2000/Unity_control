        <h1>Puzzles</h1>

<p>Puzzle Master:  Your elder ancestors have set up a series of puzzles designed to help you before the final boss.  These are so you can master your shamanistic power, and unlock season changes and calumny powers. </p>

<p><strong>These Walls Can Talk:</strong> You have to ignite a certain order of fire statues in order to gain access to an area.  </p>

<p><strong>Target shot puzzle:</strong>  Knock down all the targets before time runs out (wind power).  </p>

<p><strong>Assemble your boat:</strong>  You have to use the wind power to align a puzzle that creates a boat out of the pieces when assembled.</p>

<p><strong>Rite of Passage:</strong>  You battle enemies in an area to see how quickly you can eliminate them to get out of the area.  Too slow restarts.  </p>

<p><strong>Flight of the Eagles:</strong>  You guide eagles through a series of rings and sonic attacks (timed) to allow them to carry you through to another area. </p>

<p><strong>The Wind Talker:</strong>  A series of chimes make a distinct set of sounds.  You have to hit them with the wind in the order that the chimes sounded off.</p>

<p><strong>I was Born to Set the World on Fire:</strong>  You are on fire and you have to jump/run over enemies that will run away from you within a certain time.</p>

<p><strong>Sunlight and Rain:</strong>  You have water that flows through an area that only drains when you arrange all the pieces in the correct way.</p>

<p>**Fast Ice: ** Your ice enables you to skate fast enough before a door slams shut.  The puzzle involves not being able to set the ice anywhere, but only in certain designated spots.  You use other powers to re-arrange where the ice can be set down until itâ€™s a full path.</p>

<p><strong>Snake puzzle:</strong>  Like the game where you have a line that chases you, it tries to box you in, but you have to box it in in order to win.  Leaves a trail.  (Shamanistic, but that sort of game.)</p>

<hr><ul>
<li>Three distinct paths (Left (hard puzzles) Central (Enemies) Right (Lots of puzzles). )</li>
<li>Path fixed when you complete/cross a puzzle.</li>
</ul><h3>Obstacles</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Streams:</p>

<ul>
<li>- Winter - Freeze and walk over.</li>
<li>- Summer - Steam the water and walk through.</li>
<li>- Fall - Boat of leaves and row.

<ul>
<li>- Spring - Birds pick u up and glide you across / Spring climber acts as a bridge to get to          hidden/bonus areas</li>
<li>- Knocking rocks off the side of a mountain to create a floating path.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Higher altitude :-</p>

<ul>
<li>- Winter - Snowman

<ul>
<li>- Spring - create water then make steam. (Substitute for mini-game like Flight of the Eagles.) </li>
<li>- Fall - Magic carpet of leaves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>- Summer - Grow trees and climb</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Hidden Door/passages:</strong>
    - You can find a hidden door or passage lets say by activating symbols. Each symbol will be activated by a particular power or combination of power. The hints for the symbols,would be given prior to arriving at that location. So the player has to keep in mind what he saw.</p>

<hr><h3>Collect Shaman token</h3>

<p>Gain power from the enemies which are released from the season World to allow you to change the season. 
Refining that : free a soul/absorb a soul (whatever looks good) that is trapped in a magic room just before reaching a puzzle. Find that magic room, absorb it and viola you have the power to change the season but only for that puzzle. So for the next puzzle to need to free/absorb another soul. or defeat a spirit, absorb its soul and gain the power to control seasons. or both at some places. The player chooses in that case.</p>

<p>Collect the power from a mini-game, you win, you can change the season.  </p>
